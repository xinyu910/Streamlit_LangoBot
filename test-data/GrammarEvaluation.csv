"That's interesting, John! Sirius Black is indeed a captivating character. Let's now learn how to describe people. Can you describe Sirius Black's character to someone who has never read Harry Potter?","Sirius Black is brave and loyal. He loves Harry Potter like a son. He is a little wild and likes fun.

"Absolutely, I'll be glad to help you. Let's start with something simple. 
How about we practice describing your daily routine?
It's a great way to expand vocabulary and learn about verb tenses, particularly the present simple. 

So could you please tell me about your typical day?","Sure. I wake up at 7 AM. Then, I brush my teeth and take a shower. After that, I eat breakfast. I go to school at 8.30 AM. I have lunch at 12 PM. School finishes at 3 PM. Then, I play football with my friends. I return home at 5 PM. I do my homework, have dinner and then go to bed at 10 PM.",0,,"Your response is grammatically correct, and you've described your daily routine in detail, excellent work! Using the present simple tense as you did here is perfect for describing habitual or routine actions. Well done!",1,1,
"Fantastic! You used the present simple tense correctly to describe your daily routine. Now let's shift our focus to expressing likes and dislikes.

What are some of the things that you really enjoy about your day? What things do you dislike? Remember to include the structure ""I like..."" or ""I don't like..."" in your response.",I like eating breakfast with my family in the morning. I like going to school and learning new things. I don't like doing homework in the evening. I also don't like going to bed early.,0,,"Your sentence is grammatically correct, and you did a great job using the structure ""I like..."" and ""I don't like..."" to express your preferences! Keep up the good work!",1,1,
"Great! Thanks for sharing those. Now let's explore a bit about using adjectives in your sentences. Adjectives are words that describe or modify other words.

Can you tell me more about your school using at least three descriptive adjectives? For example, you might describe its size, color, or atmosphere.","My school is big, colorful, and lively.",0,,Your sentence is perfectly constructed and you've used adjectives effectively. Great job! Keep up the good work!,1,1,
"Well done! You've used adjectives appropriately to describe your school. 

Now, let's move to another aspect of English - the use of comparatives and superlatives. Comparatives compare two things (e.g., bigger, smaller), while superlatives express the highest degree of something (e.g., biggest, smallest).

Could you please compare your school with another place you often visit, using comparatives and superlatives? For example, ""My school is bigger than my house."" or ""The library is the quietest place in my school.""",My school is smaller than the shopping mall. The canteen is the busiest place in my school.,0,,Your response is spot on! You've applied comparatives and superlatives correctly. Great job!,1,1,
"Well done! You used comparatives and superlatives correctly. 

Now let's discuss 'prepositions of place'. Prepositions of place are words that describe where something is located. Some examples are: in, on, at, behind, under, above, and between. 

Can you describe where some specific locations or things are in your school using prepositions of place? For example, ""The library is next to the science lab."" or ""My classroom is on the second floor.""","Yes, okay. My school is big. The playground is behind the school. My favorite tree is in front of the school. The cafeteria is between the main office and my classroom. All classrooms are on the first floor except for the art room. The art room is on the second floor. The bike rack is next to the school entrance. Very big trees are around the school. My math class is at the end of the hallway.",0,,"Your response is wonderfully composed and completely grammatically correct, great job! You've made a wonderful effort in using a wide range of prepositions of place. Keep up the great work!",1,1,
"Brilliant! You've used prepositions of place correctly and effectively in your sentences.

Now, let's move to discussing 'opinions'. Expressing your opinion is crucial in any language. The easiest way to state an opinion in English is by using phrases such as ""I think"", ""I feel"", or ""I believe"".

Could you express your opinion about the subjects you're studying at school? For example, ""I think math is challenging but interesting.""",I think English is hard but fun. I believe science is very interesting. I feel history is important to learn.,0,,"Your response is impeccable! You have successfully expressed your opinions about various subjects using the phrases ""I think"", ""I believe"" and ""I feel"". No spelling or grammatical errors have been identified. Good job!",1,1,
"That's great! You expressed your opinions clearly using the phrases ""I think"", ""I feel"", and ""I believe"".

Now, I'd like to introduce the concept of 'conditionals'. Conditionals are sentences with 'if'. They talk about the result of something that might happen (in the future or present) or might have happened but didn't (in the past).

Could you try to make sentences using 'if'? For example, ""If I study hard, I will pass my English test."" or ""If it rains tomorrow, we won't play football.""","""If I wake up early, I will do exercise."" or ""If she doesn't eat dinner, she will be hungry.""",0,,"Your sentences are grammatically correct and formed correctly using conditionals! Well done, keep up the good work!",1,1,
"Perfect! You've used conditionals correctly in your sentences. 

Now, let's practice 'asking questions'. In English, we typically use 'wh' words like what, where, who, when and why to ask questions.

Could you please ask me five questions using these 'wh' words? For example, ""What's your favorite book?"" or ""Where do you live?""","1. What is your name?
2. Where are you from?
3. Who is your best friend?
4. When is your birthday?
5. Why do you like learning English?",0,,"Your sentences are all grammatically correct, well done! You've effectively used the 'wh' words to formulate questions in English. Excellent job, keep practicing!",1,1,
"Of course, welcome to English learning! 
Let's start with greetings. Could you tell me how you would greet someone during different times of the day in English?","Yes, sure! In the morning, I would say ""Good morning."" In the afternoon, I would say ""Good afternoon."" And in the evening or night, I would say ""Good evening"" or ""Good night.""",0,,"Your response is spot on and free of both grammar and spelling errors, great job! Not only did you use proper grammar, but you also successfully understood and responded to the task at hand. Keep up the good work!",1,1,
"Perfect! Now, let's talk about introducing ourselves.

"That's excellent! Books are indeed a great way to learn. 
Now, let's practice expressing likes and dislikes. Can you tell me something you really dislike and why?",I really dislike cold weather because it makes me feel uncomfortable and I cannot go outside to play.,0,,"Your response is perfectly composed with correct grammar and spelling. Good job! You've effectively answered the question providing clear reasons for your dislike, which makes your answer more interesting. Keep going!",1,1,
"I totally understand. üòä Bad weather can be a real downer. Now, let's shift to food. Could you tell me about your favorite food and why you like it?",My favorite food is pizza. I like it because it is delicious. The cheese and tomato sauce taste very good. I also like the crispy crust.,0,,Your sentence is perfectly written; it is well-structured and has no grammatical or spelling errors.

"Pizza is a favourite for many! üçï Now, let's practice asking questions. How would you ask a friend about what they did during their weekend?

Great job! Keep up the good work!,1,1,
"That's a great question! You're doing very well! Now, imagine you are ordering your favourite pizza over the phone, how would you do it? Remember to be polite and clear.","Hello! I want one large pepperoni pizza, please. No onions. Can you deliver it to my home? My address is 123 Maple Street. Thank you very much!",0,,"Your response is spot on!

"Awesome! You've mastered pizza ordering! Now, can you describe me the color, size and shape of the logo of your favorite brand? This will help you practice describing objects.","My favorite brand logo is McDonald's. It is yellow. It is very big. The shape is like a ""M"".",0,,"Your sentence is grammatically correct, good job! However, you could combine your ideas for a stronger sentence. Here's a suggestion: ""My favorite brand is McDonald's, whose very large logo is shaped like an 'M' and colored yellow."" This will help you convey your thoughts more clearly and efficiently. Keep up the good work!",1,1,
"Of course! Welcome to the exciting world of learning English! üòä To start, why don't we practice introductions? Can you tell me a bit about yourself, such as where you're from and what your favorite hobbies are?",Yes! I am from Japan. I like reading books and playing soccer.,0,,"Your sentence is grammatically correct, well done! You effectively answered the question with clear information about yourself.

Could you tell me a bit about yourself? Who you are, where you're from and what you like to do in your free time.",Hello! Me is Lee. I from Korea. I like playing football and reading on free times.,4,"Incorrect Pronoun Usage: ""Me is Lee."" should be ""I am Lee.""
Missing Verb: ""I from Korea."" should be ""I am from Korea.""
Incorrect Preposition: ""on free times"" should be ""in my free time.""
Plurality in Time Reference: ""times"" should be ""time.""","Your sentence has a few grammar mistakes. Here is the corrected version: ""Hello! I am Lee. I am from Korea. I like playing football and reading in my free time.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. It should be ""I am"" instead of ""Me is"". 
   The pronoun 'I' is used as the subject of the sentence and should always be followed by 'am'. 
   Examples: 
   - Correct usage of 'I am': ""I am reading a book.""
   - Incorrect usage: ""Me is reading a book.""
   
2. ""I from Korea"" should be ""I am from Korea"".
    When expressing your identity or origin, the verb 'am' is needed after 'I'. 
    Examples:
    - Correct: ""I am from Korea.""
    - Incorrect: ""I from Korea.""
    
3. 'On free times' is incorrect. The correct phrase is 'in my free time.'
    When speaking about something you do during a general period, like your free time, we use 'in'.
    Examples:
    - Correct: ""In the summer, I like to swim.""
    - Incorrect: ""On the summer, I like to swim.""
   
Your answer also completely addresses the question. Keep practicing!",1,1,8
Hello John! It's nice to meet you. Reading is a wonderful hobby. Let's move on to discussing your favorite book. Can you tell me about your favorite book and why it's your favorite?,Hello! I happy to meet you. My favorite book is Harry Potter. It is fun book. I liking magic and adventure in book. This book make me happy when I read.,6,"Missing Verb: ""I happy to meet you."" should be ""I am happy to meet you.""
Article Omission: ""It is fun book."" should be ""It is a fun book.""
Incorrect Verb Form and Missing Article: ""I liking magic and adventure in book."" should be ""I like magic and adventure in the book.""
Subject-Verb Agreement: ""This book make me happy"" should be ""This book makes me happy.""
Missing Object: ""when I read"" should be ""when I read it.""","Your response is understandable but let's tidy up the grammar.
Here's how your response should be: ""Hello! I'm happy to meet you. My favorite book is Harry Potter. It is a fun book. I like the magic and adventure in the book. This book makes me happy when I read it.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. ""I happy"" - The verb 'am' is missing. Correct usage is 'I am happy.' We use 'am' with the pronoun 'I' for the present tense of the verb 'be' to express states, such as feelings or who or what people are.
Examples: I am tired. I am a teacher.

2. ""It is fun book"" - The indefinite article 'a' is missing. The correct usage is 'It is a fun book.' 'A' is used before singular, countable, nonspecific nouns.
Example: I saw a dog in the park.

3. ""I liking"" - The present simple tense should be used here. The correct version is 'I like.'
Example: I like pizza.

4. ""in book"" - The definite article 'the' is missing. The correct usage is 'in the book.' 'The' is used when referring to something specific.
Example: Can you open the door?

5. ""This book make"" - For singular third-person subjects (like 'this book'), we use 'makes.' The correct version is 'This book makes.' 
Example: He makes a lot of noise when he eats.

6. ""when I read"" - We need to indicate what 'I' read. You can say ""when I read it.""
Example: I understand it better when I read it aloud",1,1,8
"Great job, John! I can see you're a big fan of Harry Potter. üëç Next, let's learn how to talk about past experiences. 

Have you ever re-read any of the Harry Potter books? If so, which one did you choose and why?","Yes, I am re-read Harry Potter book. I most like the Prisoner of Azkaban. ",3,"Verb Tense Consistency and Article Omission: ""Yes, I am re-read Harry Potter book."" should be ""Yes, I am re-reading the Harry Potter book.""
Incorrect Superlative Form: ""I most like the Prisoner of Azkaban."" should be ""I like the Prisoner of Azkaban the most.""","Your response has a few grammatical errors. Here is the correct version: ""Yes, I have re-read a Harry Potter book. I like the Prisoner of Azkaban the most.""

Errors identified and explanations:

1. Incorrect tense: ""I am re-read"" should be ""I have re-read."" 
 - We use ""I have"" in this context to refer to a past action that has relevance to the present. 
Example: ""I have read that book.""
Note: ""I am"" is used to denote a continuous action in the present. 
Example: ""I am reading that book.""

2. Incorrect usage of the superlative: ""I most like"" should be ""I like... the most.""
 - When you want to express the highest degree of something, we use ""the most"". The structure should be ""I like... the most.""
Example: ""I like chocolate the most.""

3. Missing article: ""Harry Potter book"" should be ""a Harry Potter book.""
 - When referring to a singular, non-specific item, we use ""a"" before the noun.
Example: ""I have a book.""
On the other hand, when the noun is specific, we use ""the"".
Example: ""The book I have is interesting.""",1,1,8
"That's interesting, John! Sirius Black is indeed a captivating character. Let's now learn how to describe people. Can you describe Sirius Black's character to someone who has never read Harry Potter?","Sirius Black is very kind and brave man. He is Harry Potter's godfather. He is always help Harry. He was in prison because people think he is bad, but he is not.",3,"Article Omission: ""Sirius Black is very kind and brave man."" should be ""Sirius Black is a very kind and brave man.""
Multiple Verb: ""He is always help Harry."" should be ""He always helps Harry.""
Verb Tense Consistency: ""people think he is bad"" should be ""people thought he was bad"" for consistency with the past tense in ""He was in prison.""","Your response was mostly clear and effective. However, some grammar corrections are needed for it to be perfect:
1. ""Sirius Black is very kind and brave man."" should be ""Sirius Black is a very kind and brave man."" Here, an indefinite article ""a"" is missing before ""very kind and brave man.""
2. ""He is always help Harry."" should be ""He always helps Harry."" The correct form here is the third person singular form ""helps.""
3. ""He was in prison because people think he is bad, but he is not."" should be ""He was in prison because people thought he was bad, but he is not."" We should use past tense ""thought"" instead of ""think"" here because the action in context took place in the past.

Errors and explanations: 
1. Missing indefinite article ""a"": The indefinite article ""a"" is used before phrases that describe or define a noun.
2. Use of incorrect form in third-person singular: Third person singular requires an -s or -es ending for the verbs in present tense.
3. Incorrect tense: ""Think"" is in present tense and ""thought"" is in past tense. Use ""thought"" when referring to past events.

Corrected sentences:
1. ""Sirius Black is a very kind and brave man.""
2. ""He always helps Harry.""
3. ""He was in prison because people thought he was bad, but he is not.""

Plural Form Error: ""There is dorms for students"" should be ""There are dorms for students.""

Missing Subject: ""Can be dangerous, but also is a place"" should be ""It can be dangerous, but it is also a place.""","Your description of Hogwarts is colorful and full of details! However, there a few minor grammatical and spelling errors. The corrected version should be: ""Hogwarts is a very large magical school. It has a lot of rooms, some of which are secret.

It can be dangerous, but it is also a place where students learn magic and make friends.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Spelling error: The correct spelling is 'mysterious,' not 'misterious.'
   
2. Incorrect use of ""is"" in ""some is secret"" and ""there is dorms for students."" 
    - Instead of ""is,"" you should use ""are"" because the sentences refer to several things (rooms and dorms). 
    - A corrected example would be ""Some rooms are secret,"" and ""There are dorms for students.""
    
3. Incorrect use of ""can"" in ""can be dangerous."" 
    - Instead of ""can,"" you should use ""it can"" to specify that 'it' (Hogwarts) can be dangerous. 

Keep practicing! You're improving every day!",1,1,6.5
"Excellent description, John! You really made Hogwarts come alive with your words. üòä Now, let's practise expressing future plans. Do you plan to read any other books by J.K. Rowling or any other authors? If so, which ones and why?","Yes, I have plans to read more books of J.K Rowlling. I enjoy Harry Potter very much. After finish, I want to read 'The Cuckoo's Calling.' It is more adult, but I like mistery, so I think it will be good for me!",4,"Preposition Usage and Spelling Error: ""books of J.K Rowlling"" should be ""books by J.K. Rowling.""
Verb Form: ""After finish,"" should be ""After finishing,""
Spelling Error: ""mistery"" should be ""mystery.""","Your sentence has a few minor spelling and grammatical errors. Here's the corrected version: ""Yes, I have plans to read more books by J.K. Rowling. I enjoy Harry Potter very much. After I finish, I want to read 'The Cuckoo's Calling.' It is more mature, but I like mystery, so I think it will be good for me!""

Errors identified and their explanations:
1. Spelling errors: ""Rowlling"" should be spelled as ""Rowling"" and ""mistery"" should be spelled as ""mystery.""

2. Use of preposition: The correct phrase would be ""books by J.K. Rowling,"" not ""books of J.K Rowling."" We use the preposition 'by' to indicate the author of a book.
An example of the correct usage is ""I am reading a book by Stephen King.""

3. Incorrect verb form: After 'after', the verb form should be 'finishing' not 'finish'.
To fix this the verb needs to be in the -ing form, so the sentence should look like this: ""After finishing, I want to read 'The Cuckoo's Calling.'""

4. Word choice: The word ""adult"" generally refers to a person who is grown up, while ""mature"" is a more appropriate word to describe content that is intended for adults or grown-ups.
Example: ""The novel is intended for a mature audience due to its complex themes.""

However, you have effectively answered the question and your future reading plans sound great! Keep up the good work.",1,1,7.6
"Good choices, John! üëç ""Fantastic Beasts"" and ""Percy Jackson"" are indeed interesting reads. Now, let's practice conversational English. How would you recommend the Harry Potter series to someone who hasn't read them?","Harry Potter is a very good book! Have magic and adventure, many exciting. You must read it, you will love it!",2,"Missing Subject and Syntax: ""Have magic and adventure, many exciting."" should be ""It has magic and adventure, and it's very exciting.""","Your sentence is mostly correct, but it could use a bit of rephrasing for clarity and proper grammar. 
Here's the corrected version: ""Harry Potter is a very good book! It has magic and adventure, and many exciting moments. You must read it, you will love it!""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Missing subject ""it"" before ""Have"".
   Subjects are necessary in English sentences. In your case, the book (Harry Potter) is the subject doing the action (having magic and adventure).
   
2. Using the incomplete phrase ""many exciting"".
    In English, the adjective (exciting) usually can't stand alone without a noun unless it's part of a larger sentence structure. We need to know what is 'exciting'. In this case, 'moments' or 'parts' would fit well.

Example with proper use of ""it"": ""It rains a lot in the winter.""
Example with an adjective + noun: ""There are many exciting scenes in the movie.""",1,1,8
"Perfect recommendation, John! üëå Now, let's shift our focus to practicing daily life situations. Imagine you are at a bookstore and you can't find Harry Potter book. What would you say to the bookstore clerk?",I want find the Harry Potter book but I can't find it. Can you help me?,1,"Missing Infinitive Marker: ""I want find the Harry Potter book"" should be ""I want to find the Harry Potter book.""","Your sentence has a minor grammatical mistake. The correct sentence should be: ""I want to find the Harry Potter book but I can't. Can you help me?""
Errors identified and explanation:
1. Missing preposition ""to"" after ""want"" before verb ""find"", creating the infinitive form.
   In the English language, ""to"" is used together with the base form of a verb to express purpose or intention. When you say ""I want to find"", you are expressing your intention to perform the action of finding something.
Examples of correct usage:
- ""I want to eat sushi for dinner.""
- ""I want to read a book.""
Remember to always use the base form of a verb with ""to"" after the verb ""want"". 

Your response to the question is great as you've managed to navigate the situation appropriately. Just pay attention to the small grammatical errors. Keep it up!",1,1,8
"Hi there! Absolutely, I'd be glad to help. How about we practice introductory phrases and greetings? For instance, how would you introduce yourself to someone for the first time in English?",Hello! Mine name is Jack. I am from Spain. Nice to meet you.,1,"Incorrect Possessive Pronoun: ""Mine name is Jack."" should be ""My name is Jack.""","Your sentence is almost perfect, there is just a small grammatical error. It should be: ""Hello! My name is Jack. I am from Spain. Nice to meet you.""

Errors identified and explanations:

1. Incorrect use of possessive pronoun ""Mine"" instead of ""My"" in ""Mine name is Jack.""
    - ""Mine"" is a possessive pronoun that is used in cases where the noun following the pronoun has already been mentioned or when it‚Äôs clear what the noun is. It usually doesn't come before the noun. For example, ""This book is mine."" 
    - ""My"" is a possessive adjective used before a noun. Example: ""My name is Jack.""

Variations of the correct usage are:
""My dog is playing in the park.""
""Is this car yours or mine?"" 

Good job on the rest of the sentence! Keep going, you are doing well.",1,1,8
"Hi John, it's a pleasure to meet you too! That's a perfect introduction. Great job! üéâ Now, how would you ask about someone's interests? Remember, it's a good topic to keep a conversation going.","Hello, I can ask like this. ""What do you like to do in your free time?"" or ""Which is your favorite hobbie?""",2,"Spelling Error and Question Structure: ""Which is your favorite hobbie?"" should be ""What is your favorite hobby?""","Your sentences are almost perfect! There's just one minor mistake. The word 'hobbie' should be 'hobby'. Also, 'which' is usually used for choices, we use 'what' for open-ended questions. 

Your corrected sentences could be: 
""What do you like to do in your free time?"" or ""What is your favorite hobby?""

Errors identified and explanations: 
1. Grammar - Misuse of 'which' instead of 'what': 
'Which' should be used when you are referring to a choice or an option. 'What' is better used for open-ended questions.
Example with 'which': ""Which do you prefer, coffee or tea?"" 
Example with 'what': ""What is your favorite color?""

2. Spelling error - 'hobbie' should be 'hobby': 
When spelling, be careful to use the correct form of the word. 

Keep up the good work! You're learning very quickly.",1,1,8
"Hi John! That's another good sentence. üëç Now, what if you want to say you share the same interest with someone? How would you express that in English?","Hello! I can say, ""We have same hobby"" for saying I share the same interest with someone.",1,"Missing Article: ""We have same hobby"" should be ""We have the same hobby.""","Your sentence is almost perfect, there's just a small grammatical error. The corrected sentence should be: ""We have the same hobby.""

Error identified and explanation:
1. Missing of the definite article ""the"" before ""same hobby"".
The definite article ""the"" is used before a noun followed by a defining or limiting modifier like ""same"". The usage of ""the"" makes it clear that you and the other person are talking about a specific shared interest or hobby. 

For example, you'd say ""We live in the same city"" or ""They have the same love for music"". 

Remember, if you're describing something specific that the listener is aware of, you should most likely use ""the"". 

Hence, the corrected sentence should be ""We have the same hobby"". Well done for trying though, keep it up!",1,1,8
"Exactly, John! üëè That's correct. Now, how would you express your own interests or hobbies in English? For instance, what do you generally like to do during your free time in France?","In my free time, I like read books and listen music. Sometimes I play football with friends.",2,"Missing Infinitive Marker: ""I like read books"" should be ""I like to read books.""
Missing Preposition: ""listen music"" should be ""listen to music.""","Your sentence is almost perfect, but there are a couple of minor errors. It should be: ""In my free time, I like to read books and listen to music. Sometimes, I play football with friends.""
Errors identified and explanations:
1. Missing 'to' in 'I like read book' and 'listen music'.
The phrase should be 'I like to read books' and 'listen to music'. You should use 'to' after the verb 'like' when you're talking about a hobby or something you enjoy doing. 

Let's look at some examples:
Incorrect: I like play tennis. 
Correct: I like to play tennis.

Incorrect: I like listen to rock music.
Correct: I like to listen to rock music.

Awesome work overall ‚Äì keep it up!",1,1,4
"Great, John! You have interesting hobbies. üìöüéæüç≥ Let's change the topic a little bit.

Also, can I have a cold soda too?""",2,"Missing Infinitive Marker: ""I want order big steak"" should be ""I want to order a big steak.""
Spelling Error: ""pleasee"" should be ""please.""
Redundancy in Request: ""too"" is not necessary after ""Also,"" The sentence is still gramatically correct though","The content of your sentence is clear, but let's fix up a few minor grammar and spelling errors:

Your sentence: ""Hello, I want order big steak and french fries, pleasee. Also, can I have a cold soda too?"" 

Corrected sentence: ""Hello, I would like to order a big steak and French fries, please. Also, can I have a cold soda too?"" 

Errors identified: 
1. You accidentally added an extra 'e' at the end of 'please'. Spelling is important for effective communication, keep practicing!
2. You used 'want order' instead of 'would like to order', which is grammatically incorrect.
     - Explanation: When ordering something, we should use 'would like to' followed by 'order'. 'Want order' is incorrect because a verb cannot directly follow another verb without a preposition or conjunction. 
     - Examples:
       Correct: ""I would like to order a pizza.""
       Incorrect: ""I want order a pizza.""

Keep on practicing and you'll continue to improve!",1,1,8
"Well done, John! That's perfectly stated. üëç Now, suppose your order was incorrect when it arrived, how would you respond to the waiter to communicate the mistake? Don't forget to use polite language.","I'm sorry, but I think I made a mistake on the order. This food is not what I ordering. Can you please fix this?",1,"Verb Tense Error: ""what I ordering"" should be ""what I ordered.""","Your response was polite and it clearly communicated your issue, which is great! But there were a couple of grammar mistakes. Let's correct them:
1. ""This food is not what I ordering."" The correct sentence should be: ""This food is not what I ordered."" 
    - Explanation: When referring to a past event (ordering the food), you should use the past tense verb 'ordered' instead of 'ordering'.
2. ""Can you please fix this?"" The more appropriate phrasing would be: ""Could you please fix this?""
    - Explanation: In formal and polite contexts, 'could' is often used instead of 'can' to make requests or ask for permission.

Here's how your corrected response looks: ""I'm sorry, but I think there was a mistake with the order. This food is not what I ordered. Could you please fix this?"" 

Amazing job on communicating effectively with politeness! Keep practicing, your English is really improving.",1,1,6
"That's right, John! You handled that very politely and correctly. üåü Now, let's imagine you're in a shop, how would you ask the seller for the price of an item you're interested in?","Excuse me, how much does this item costed?",1,"Verb Tense Error: ""costed"" should be ""cost.""","Your sentence is almost perfect, but there's a small grammatical error. 

The correct version is: ""Excuse me, how much does this item cost?""

Errors identified and explanations:

1. Incorrect use of the past tense form 'costed'. The verb 'to cost' is a special case. Unlike most verbs, it doesn't change in the past tense 
    - When 'to cost' refers to the value or price of something, it does not change in past tense. We still say 'it cost', not 'it costed'.
    - Correct usage examples: 
      - How much did that dress cost? (Past)
      - How much does that dress cost? (Present)

Keep practicing! You're getting better each time.",1,1,4
"Exactly, John! Great job! üéâ What would you say if the item was too expensive and you didn't want to buy it anymore? Remember, remain polite and respectful.","I would say, ""I'm sorry, but item is to much expensive for me. I don't wanting to buy it now.""",3,"Article Omission and Adverb Misplacement: ""item is to much expensive"" should be ""the item is too expensive.""
Verb Form: ""I don't wanting to buy it"" should be ""I don't want to buy it.""","Your sentence has a few grammatical issues. The corrected sentence is: ""I'm sorry, but this item is too expensive for me. I don't want to buy it now."" 

Errors identified and explanations:

1. Missing determiner ""this"" before the noun ""item"".
   We use ""this"" to refer to specific individuals or things which are close to the speaker or near in context. For example, 'This book is interesting.' 

2. Misuse of ""to"" instead of ""too"" and misplacement of 'much'.
   ""Too"" is an adverb that means ""excessively"" or ""more than good or necessary"" and should be used before an adjective without a noun or adverb. ""Much"" should come just after 'too'. Correct usage: 'This is too much for me to handle.' 

3. Incorrect verb form in ""I don't wanting"".
   After 'do not / don't', we use the base form of the verb. That's why it's 'I don't want' instead of 'I don't wanting'. Correct usage: 'I don't want to leave.'

Here's the suggested version of your sentence: ""I'm sorry, but this item is too expensive for me. I no longer want to buy it.""",1,1,8
"Absolutely, I'll be glad to help you. Let's start with something simple. 
How about we practice describing your daily routine?
It's a great way to expand vocabulary and learn about verb tenses, particularly the present simple. 

So could you please tell me about your typical day?","I wake up at 7 o'clock in morning. Then I brush my teeths and eat breakfast. After that, I go to work. I finish work at 5 o'clock and I go home. Then, I cook dinner and see TV. I go to sleep at 11 o'clock.",3,"Article Use and Time Expression: ""at 7 o'clock in morning"" should be ""at 7 o'clock in the morning.""
Plural Form Error: ""my teeths"" should be ""my teeth.""
Verb Use: ""see TV"" should be ""watch TV.""","Good start, but let's work on a couple of mistakes:

The correct sentence should be: ""I wake up at 7 o'clock in the morning. Then I brush my teeth and eat breakfast. After that, I go to work. I finish work at 5 o'clock and I go home. Then, I cook dinner and watch TV. I go to sleep at 11 o'clock.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. The use of ""in"" should be followed by ""the"" when talking about parts of the day. So instead of ""in morning"" it should be ""in the morning"".

'Say' about when to use ""the"":
Use 'the' when you are talking about something that is already clear. For example: 'I love the morning air.'
In general, ""the"" is used before times of the day, for instance, 'in the evening, in the afternoon.'

2. In English, the word ""teeth"" is already plural so there's no need to add an 's' at the end. So instead of ""teeths"", it should be ""teeth"". 

3. Lastly, use ""watch"" instead of ""see"" when talking about TV. Therefore, instead of ""see TV"" it should be ""watch TV"".

For example:
""I watch TV every evening.""
""I'm watching TV now.""

Keep practicing, you're doing well!",1,1,8
"Fantastic! You used the present simple tense correctly to describe your daily routine. Now let's shift our focus to expressing likes and dislikes.

What are some of the things that you really enjoy about your day? What things do you dislike? Remember to include the structure ""I like..."" or ""I don't like..."" in your response.",I like eat breakfast with my family and going to school. I don't like doing homeworks and cleaning my room. ,2,"Verb Tense Consistency: ""I like eat breakfast"" should be ""I like eating breakfast.""
Plural Form Error: ""homeworks"" should be ""homework.""","Your sentence is almost perfect, but there are a few minor errors. The correct version should be: ""I like eating breakfast with my family and going to school. I don't like doing homework or cleaning my room.""

Errors identified and explanations:

1. Missing gerund form after ""like"": Remember that after ""like"", you need to use the -ing form (gerund) of the verb. So instead of ""eat"", it should be ""eating"". Examples: 'I like playing soccer.', 'I like reading books.'

2. Incorrect plural of ""homework"": the word ""homework"" is uncountable in English, which means it doesn't have a plural form. It's always ""homework"", not ""homeworks"". A correct use is in the sentence: 'I finished my homework.' 

Great job overall, just bear these corrections in mind as you continue practicing! Keep going.",1,1,8
"Great! Thanks for sharing those. Now let's explore a bit about using adjectives in your sentences. Adjectives are words that describe or modify other words.

Can you tell me more about your school using at least three descriptive adjectives? For example, you might describe its size, color, or atmosphere.",My school is very big and beautiful. Teachers is nice and kind. I loving my school a lot.,2,"Plural Form Error: ""Teachers is nice"" should be ""Teachers are nice.""
Verb Tense Consistency: ""I loving my school"" should be ""I love my school.""","Your sentence is almost correct, but there are a few minor grammatical errors. Here's the corrected version of your sentence: 

""My school is very big and beautiful. The teachers are nice and kind. I love my school a lot.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. ""Teachers is"" should be ""teachers are"". 
    In English, we use 'is' with singular nouns (e.g., ""The teacher is nice"") and 'are' with plural nouns (e.g., ""The teachers are nice"").
2. ""loving"" should be ""love"". This is because the present continuous (loving) is not typically used with stative verbs like love, want, need, etc. The correct usage is ""I love"".

Great use of adjectives to describe your school! Your enthusiasm comes across clearly in your writing. Keep practicing!",1,1,7
"Well done! You've used adjectives appropriately to describe your school. 

Now, let's move to another aspect of English - the use of comparatives and superlatives. Comparatives compare two things (e.g., bigger, smaller), while superlatives express the highest degree of something (e.g., biggest, smallest).

Could you please compare your school with another place you often visit, using comparatives and superlatives? For example, ""My school is bigger than my house."" or ""The library is the quietest place in my school.""",My school is bigger than my house and the library is quietest place in the school. The cafeteria has lesser tables than the library.,2,"Superlative Form: ""the library is quietest place in the school"" should be ""the library is the quietest place in the school.""
Comparative Form: ""The cafeteria has lesser tables than the library"" should be ""The cafeteria has fewer tables than the library.""","Great job on using comparatives and superlatives! However, there are a couple of minor corrections needed in your sentence. 

Your sentence should be: ""My school is bigger than my house and the library is the quietest place in the school. The cafeteria has fewer tables than the library.""

Errors identified and explanations:

1. Incorrect comparative form: You used ""lesser"" instead of ""fewer"". The correct comparative to use when comparing countable items like tables is ""fewer"". 
    ""Lesser"" is used to mean smaller in size, value, or importance, usually used in a more formal context, for example: He received the lesser share of the proceeds.
    ""Fewer"" is used to mean a reduced number of items or people, for example: Fewer than 20 applicants turned up for the interview.
    
2. In the phrase ""quietest place in the school"", ""the"" should be used before ""quietest place"" because it's clear that we are referring to a specific place, which is the quietest one. 

Well done on attempting this exercise! With a bit more practice, you'll master it.",1,1,4
"Well done! You used comparatives and superlatives correctly. 

Now let's discuss 'prepositions of place'. Prepositions of place are words that describe where something is located. Some examples are: in, on, at, behind, under, above, and between. 

Can you describe where some specific locations or things are in your school using prepositions of place? For example, ""The library is next to the science lab."" or ""My classroom is on the second floor.""","Sure, my English classroom are on the first floor. The math classroom is above the library. My locker is between my English classroom and sciene lab.",2,"Singular Form Error: ""my English classroom are on the first floor"" should be ""my English classroom is on the first floor.""
Spelling Error: ""sciene lab"" should be ""science lab.""","Your sentences are nearly perfect, good work! There are only a few minor errors to correct for accuracy.

Corrections:
1. ""my English classroom are on the first floor"" should be ""my English classroom is on the first floor"". In English, we use 'is' with singular nouns (like 'classroom') and 'are' with plural nouns.
For example:
- My book is on the table. (singular noun)
- My books are on the table. (plural noun)

2. ""sciene"" is a spelling error. The correct spelling is ""science"".

Here's the corrected version of your sentences: 
""Sure, my English classroom is on the first floor. The math classroom is above the library. My locker is between my English classroom and science lab.""

You've been doing a great job with Prepositions of Place, keep it up!",1,1,8
"Brilliant! You've used prepositions of place correctly and effectively in your sentences.

Now, let's move to discussing 'opinions'. Expressing your opinion is crucial in any language. The easiest way to state an opinion in English is by using phrases such as ""I think"", ""I feel"", or ""I believe"".

Could you express your opinion about the subjects you're studying at school? For example, ""I think math is challenging but interesting.""",I think science is very interesting. I believe maths is very hard. I feel english language is funney but difficult to lern.,3,"Spelling Errors: ""funney"" should be ""funny,"" and ""lern"" should be ""learn."" 
Capitalize: ""english"" shoud be ""English""","Your sentences have effectively conveyed your opinion, well done! However, there are a couple of spelling errors. Let's fix them:

Corrected Sentence: ""I think science is very interesting. I believe maths is very hard. I feel English language is funny but difficult to learn.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Spelling error: 'funney' should be corrected to 'funny.' 
2. Spelling error: 'lern' should be corrected to 'learn.'
3. Do remember to always capitalize the first letter of 'English' as it is a proper noun.

Keep practicing and soon these corrections will become natural to you!",1,1,7.333333333
"That's great! You expressed your opinions clearly using the phrases ""I think"", ""I feel"", and ""I believe"".

Now, I'd like to introduce the concept of 'conditionals'. Conditionals are sentences with 'if'. They talk about the result of something that might happen (in the future or present) or might have happened but didn't (in the past).

Could you try to make sentences using 'if'? For example, ""If I study hard, I will pass my English test."" or ""If it rains tomorrow, we won't play football.""","Sure! I can will try. 
""If I go to bed early, I will wake up early."" 
""If I don't eat healthy, I will be sick.""",2,"Modal Verb Redundancy: ""can will"" should be ""will""
Adverb Form: ""healthy"" should be ""healthily""","Your sentences are great! You have a good understanding of conditionals. However, there's a minor mistake in the beginning of your response.

1. ""I can will try."" should be ""I can try."" or ""I will try.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. You used both 'can' and 'will' together. Here, you should use only one of them. 
'Can' indicates the ability to do something. For example, 'I can swim.' implies you have the ability to swim. 
'Will' is used to express future intentions, promises or predictions. For example, 'I will travel to Paris next month.' shows your intention.

Here are examples for correct usage:
- 'I can swim.' (Ability)
- 'I will help you.' (Future intention)

So, the corrected version of your sentence is either ""Sure! I can try."" or ""Sure! I will try.""                 
",0,0.5,4
"Perfect! You've used conditionals correctly in your sentences. 

Now, let's practice 'asking questions'. In English, we typically use 'wh' words like what, where, who, when and why to ask questions.

Errors identified and explanations:

1) In your second sentence, the correct version should be: ""What is your favorite food?"" The possessive pronoun ""your"" replaced ""you"" in this context.

2) In the third question, it should be ""Who is your best friend?"" We use ""is"" to connect ""who"" and ""your best friend"" to form a proper question.

3) The correct form of the fourth sentence is: ""When is your birthday?"" Here also, the verb ""is"" is required to correctly form the question.

Corrected version of your response:

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Usage of ""what's your job"" and ""how is your favourite food"" instead of ""what your job is"" and ""what your favourite food is"".

Verb Form: ""relax"" should be ""relaxed.""","Your sentence has a minor grammatical error. It should be: ""In my free time, I like to read books. Reading books makes me feel relaxed.""

Errors Identified & Explanations:
1. Incorrect verb usage: ""is make"" should be ""makes"". 
The present simple tense ""makes"" follows a single noun subject (like ""reading books"") when expressing a habitual action.
Example: Eating healthy makes me feel good.

2. Incorrect adjective form - 'relax' should be 'relaxed'
'Feel' should be followed by an adjective here to describe the state or condition. 
Example: I feel excited about the trip tomorrow.

"That's excellent! Books are indeed a great way to learn. 
Now, let's practice expressing likes and dislikes. Can you tell me something you really dislike and why?",I really doesn't like snakes. Snakes are scary and dangeruos. They make me frighting.,3,"Subject-Verb Agreement: ""doesn't like"" should be ""don't like"" for the first-person singular subject ""I.""
Spelling Errors: ""dangeruos"" should be ""dangerous,"" and ""frighting"" should be ""frightened.""","Your sentence has a few grammatical and spelling errors. Let's correct them:

Corrected Sentence: ""I really don't like snakes. Snakes are scary and dangerous. They make me frightened.""

Errors identified and explanations:

1. Incorrect use of ""doesn't"" instead of ""don't"".
    - ""Doesn't"" is the contraction of ""does not"", and is used with he, she, or it in the present tense. 
    - ""Don't""  is the contraction of ""do not"", and is used with I, you, we, or they. 
   Example for ""doesn't"": She doesn't like snakes. 
   Example for ""don't"": I don't like snakes.

2. Spelling error: ""dangeruos"" should be ""dangerous"".

3. Incorrect use of adjective: ""frighting"" isn't a word. The correct term should be ""frightened"".
    - ""Frightened"" can be used to describe being afraid or scared. 
    Example: They make me feel frightened.",1,1,8
"I totally understand. üòä Bad weather can be a real downer. Now, let's shift to food. Could you tell me about your favorite food and why you like it?","Yes, I love pizza very much. It tastes so good, and I can put anything on it. Cheese, sauce and many type of toppings make me happy.",1,"Plural Form: ""many type of toppings"" should be ""many types of toppings.""","Your sentence is almost perfect, but there is a minor grammatical error.

The corrected sentence is: ""Yes, I love pizza very much. It tastes so good, and I can put anything on it. Cheese, sauce and many types of toppings make me happy.""

Error identified and explanations:

1. The use of ""type"" should be in its plural form ""types"" when referring to multiple variants or categories. 
In your sentence, you're referring to various kinds of pizza toppings so you should say ""many types of toppings"". 

Examples include: ""They sell many types of fruits at the market."" (when referring to various kinds of fruits) or ""There are many types of vehicles on the road."" (when referring to different categories of vehicles) 

You responded effectively to the question by explaining what you like about your favorite food. Good job!",1,1,8
"Pizza is a favourite for many! üçï Now, let's practice asking questions. How would you ask a friend about what they did during their weekend? Try to make your question as engaging as possible.",What you do in weekends? ,3," Missing Auxiliary Verb, Missing Article and Incorrect Preposition: ""What you do in weekends?"" should be ""What did you do on the weekends?""","Your sentence has a grammatical error. The correct phrase is: ""What did you do on the weekend?""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Incorrect use of the present simple tense ""do"" instead of the past simple tense ""did.""
The past tense ""did"" is used when talking about events that happened in the past. In your sentence, you're asking about a past event, so you should use ""did"" instead of ""do"". Examples: 
- What did you do yesterday?
- What did he do last night?

2. Incorrect use of the preposition ""in"" with ""weekend,"" instead, ""on"" should be used.
We use ""on"" when we refer to days and dates. The weekend is considered as a part of the week, so ""on"" is the appropriate preposition to use. Examples:  
-  What did you do on Monday? 
-  What will you do on the weekend?

It's important to make sure your question makes sense and attracts the person you're speaking to. So here's a more engaging way to phrase your sentence: ""What exciting things did you get up to on the weekend?""",0,0.67,4
"That's a great question! You're doing very well! Now, imagine you are ordering your favourite pizza over the phone, how would you do it? Remember to be polite and clear.","Hello, I want to order a pizza. I need one large pizza with pepperoni and olives. No any cheese, Please. Thank you.",1,"Incorrect Article Use: ""No any cheese, Please."" should be ""No cheese, please.""","Your sentence is almost perfect, just a small grammatical error. It should be: ""Hello, I want to order a pizza. I need one large pizza with pepperoni and olives. No cheese, please. Thank you.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Incorrect use of ""any"" before ""cheese"". 
Usually, ""any"" is used in negative sentences and questions, or after 'if', to talk about an indefinite or non-specific quantity. 
In your context, ""No"" is already providing a negative sense. ""Any"" in this context is unnecessary.
Examples: 
- I don't have any money.
- Are there any apples left?
- If there are any issues, let me know.

Correct version without ""any"": No cheese.
Example: I don't want sugar in my coffee, please.

Missing Article: ""Logo size is medium."" should be ""The logo size is medium.""; ""The shape of logo is circle"" should be ""The shape of the logo is circle""","Great job responding to the query! However, there are some minor spelling and grammatical errors in your response:

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Favorit - This is a spelling error and the correct spelling is 'favorite'.
2. ""logo colour is silver"" - Here, 'the' is missing before 'logo colour'. In English, a definite article like 'the' is often used before a specific object or item.
3. ""The shape of logo is circle"" - Here, 'the' should be used in front of 'logo' and 'circle'. The use of the definite article 'the' indicates that a specific item is being referred to.

I come from Brazil. My hobbies are soccer and reading.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Incorrect form of ""thank"": It should be ""thanks.""
""Thanks"" should be used when expressing gratitude. For example, ""I say thanks to my friends for helping me."" On the other hand, ""thank"" is used when you want to express that you thank someone. For example, ""I thank my friends for their support.""

Remember to use 'thanks' when you are expressing gratitude and 'thank' when you are specifying whom you want to give thanks to.

"That's great! üìö‚öΩÔ∏è Reading books is an excellent way to learn English. Tell me, what kind of books do you enjoy reading? Fiction? Nonfiction? What are some of your favorite books?

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Use incomplete verb form: 'read' instead of 'reading.'
In this context, after ""enjoy"", we should use the ""ing"" form of the verb to indicate an activity that you take pleasure in doing. So, using ""reading"" instead of ""read"" is the correct form. Here are additional examples that illustrate the correct usage:  ""I enjoy eating pizza."" or ""They enjoy playing soccer."" Good job on specifying your favorite book, keep up the good work!",1,1,8
"Fantastic! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Harry Potter series is popular worldwide. Can you describe one of the characters from Harry Potter in your own words?

She has curly hair, and she alway carry a lot of books. Hermoine is brave and loyal. She helps Harry on many situations.",3,"Missing comma: ""Harry Potter's best friend Hermoine Granger"" should be ""Harry Potter's best friend, Hermoine Granger""
Spelling Error: ""Hermoine"" should be ""Hermione.""
Subject-Verb Agreement: ""she alway carry"" should be ""she always carries.""
Incorrect preposition: ""on many situations"" should be ""in many situations""","Your sentence structure is mostly correct, but there are a few small grammar and spelling mistakes. Your corrected sentence could read: ""Harry Potter's best friend, Hermione Granger, is a very smart girl. She has curly hair and always carries a lot of books. Hermione is brave and loyal. She has helped Harry in many situations."" 

Errors identified and explanations:

1. Spelling error: It should be 'Hermione' not 'Hermoine.'
2. Grammar error: Instead of 'alway carry,' the correct form to use is 'always carries.' This form is used because it refers to a habit or repeated action. Examples: She always walks to school, He usually goes to the gym.
3. Grammar error: 'She helps Harry on many situations' should be 'She has helped Harry in many situations.' The preposition 'in' is more appropriate to use here because it refers to being within a context or environment. We use 'in' when referring to situations, places, and conditions. Examples: He flourished in a difficult situation, They discussed it in a meeting.
4. Grammar error: There should be a comma after 'Hermione Granger' to offset the appositive phrase ('Harry Potter's best friend'). An appositive is a noun or noun phrase that renames another noun right next to it and is set off by commas. Example: My dog, a golden retriever, loves to play fetch.",1,1,7
"Nicely done! üòä Hermione is indeed an iconic character. Now, let's use the Past Simple tense, which is used for actions completed in the past. Can you tell me what happened in yesterday's soccer match that you played or watched?",I watched a match yesterday. My favorite team losing but they try hard. ,2,"Past tense: ""My favorite team losing"" should be ""My favorite team lost.""
Past tense: ""try"" should be ""tried.""","Your sentence has some grammatical issues. The corrected version should be: ""I watched a match yesterday. My favorite team lost but they tried hard.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. 'losing' should be 'lost':
The past simple form of 'lose' is 'lost'. This tense is used for actions completed in the past.
E.g. ""I lost my keys yesterday."" or ""They lost the game last night.""

2. 'try' should be 'tried':
Similarly, 'try' in the past simple tense is 'tried', not 'try'. This correction aligns with the use of the past simple tense.
E.g. ""I tried to finish my homework before dinner."" or ""The athlete tried his best in the race.""",1,1,8
"Well done!‚öΩÔ∏è Now, let's shift gears and practice making requests and asking for things politely. Can you ask me to lend you a book in English? Try using phrases like ""Could you..."" or ""Would you mind..."".",Could you lend me a English book?,1,"Article Use: ""a English book"" should be ""an English book.""","Your sentence is almost correct, but it has a small grammatical error. It should be ""an English book"" not ""a English book.""
Errors identified and explanation:
1. Using the incorrect article ""a"" before ""English"". The rule is: we use ""an"" before words that start with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) because it makes them easier to pronounce. Therefore ""an"" should be used before ""English"" instead of ""a"".

Here are few more examples to illustrate the correct usage:
- Could you lend me an umbrella?
- I am an engineer.
- She is an honest person.

So the corrected sentence is: ""Could you lend me an English book?"" Good job on using polite phrases to make a request!",1,1,8
"Well done! üìö Jolly good! Now, let's use a bit of conditionals, specifically the second conditional. It's used to talk about imagined situations, usually things that might never happen. For example, ""If I won the lottery, I would buy a house."" Can you tell me what you would do if you could meet JK Rowling, the author of Harry Potter?","If I could meet JK Rowling, I was very happy. I would ask her about her favorite character in Harry Potter.",1,"Verb Tense Consistency: ""I was very happy."" should be ""I would be very happy.""","Your response is almost perfect, though there's a minor grammatical error in it. 

Error and explanation:
1. Incorrect usage of ""was"" in ""I was very happy.""
   In the second conditional, we use ""would"" plus the base form of the main verb. When talking about your feelings in the imagined situation, you should use ""would be"" instead of ""was"". 

For instance, you could say ""If I could meet JK Rowling, I would be very happy.""

Additional examples:
- If I had a car, I would drive to work.
- If it rained tomorrow, I would stay at home.

Here's a corrected version of your response: ""If I could meet JK Rowling, I would be very happy. I would ask her about her favorite character in Harry Potter.""",1,1,8
"Fantastic response! üí´ Now, let's focus on descriptive language. Can you describe Japan, your homeland, using adjectives? Try to use words that describe the sights, sound, or even the feel of the place.",Japan is a very beutiful country.

Subject-Verb Agreement: ""people is polite"" should be ""people are polite.""","Your sentence has a minor spelling mistake and a grammatical issue. It should be: ""Japan is a very beautiful country. The food is delicious and the people are polite.""
Errors identified and explanations:
1. Spelling error: 'beutiful' should be corrected to 'beautiful.'
2. Grammatical error: 'people is polite' should be corrected to 'people are polite.' The word 'people' is considered plural, so we use 'are' instead of 'is' with it.

Let's see some usage examples:
Incorrect: People is friendly.
Correct: People are friendly.

Continue practicing, you're making progress! You did a wonderful job of beginning to describe Japan, but don't forget to include more adjectives that tell us about the sights, sounds, and the feel of the country next time.",1,1,8
"Well done! üáØüáµ That's a really nice description of Japan. Let's move onto practicing usage of prepositions of place and direction. Could you guide me through your house as if I've never been there before? Try using prepositions like 'in', 'on', 'at', 'across', 'through', etc.","Sure. When you enter my house, the kitchen is on the right. The living room is in left side. Upstairs, bathroom is at end of the hallway.
",3,"Preposition Use and Missing Article: ""The living room is in left side."" should be ""The living room is on the left side.""
Missing Article: ""at end of the hallway"" should be ""at the end of the hallway""","Your response is very close to being correct, but there are a few grammar issues. The revised sentence should be: ""Sure. When you enter my house, the kitchen is on the right. The living room is on the left side. Upstairs, the bathroom is at the end of the hallway.""

Here are the errors identified with explanations:
1. Misuse of the preposition 'in' before 'left side'. 
Prepositions 'on' and 'in' have different uses. We use 'on' when we want to indicate that something is in a position above something else and touching it or in position at the side of someone or something. Here, you should use ""on"" as the living room is at the side of the entrance. For example, 'The shop is on the left side of the street.'

2. Omission of the article 'the' before 'left side' and 'end of the hallway'.
When you specify something using a noun, use 'the' before it.  In this case, while referring to a very specific place: 'the left side' and 'the end of the hallway,' 'the' is necessary. 

Well done trying to use prepositions. Keep practicing!",1,1,7

"Great! Thanks for sharing those. Now let's explore a bit about using adjectives in your sentences. Adjectives are words that describe or modify other words.

Can you tell me more about your school using at least three descriptive adjectives? For example, you might describe its size, color, or atmosphere.","My school is big, colorful, and lively.",0,NA
"Well done! You've used adjectives appropriately to describe your school. 

Now, let's move to another aspect of English - the use of comparatives and superlatives. Comparatives compare two things (e.g., bigger, smaller), while superlatives express the highest degree of something (e.g., biggest, smallest).

Could you please compare your school with another place you often visit, using comparatives and superlatives?

The canteen is the busiest place in my school.,0,NA
"Well done! You used comparatives and superlatives correctly.

"Brilliant! You've used prepositions of place correctly and effectively in your sentences.

Now, let's move to discussing 'opinions'. Expressing your opinion is crucial in any language. The easiest way to state an opinion in English is by using phrases such as ""I think"", ""I feel"", or ""I believe"".

Could you express your opinion about the subjects you're studying at school? For example, ""I think math is challenging but interesting.""",I think English is hard but fun. I believe science is very interesting. I feel history is important to learn.,0,NA
"That's great! You expressed your opinions clearly using the phrases ""I think"", ""I feel"", and ""I believe"".

Now, I'd like to introduce the concept of 'conditionals'. Conditionals are sentences with 'if'. They talk about the result of something that might happen (in the future or present) or might have happened but didn't (in the past).

Could you try to make sentences using 'if'? For example, ""If I study hard, I will pass my English test."" or ""If it rains tomorrow, we won't play football.""","""If I wake up early, I will do exercise."" or ""If she doesn't eat dinner, she will be hungry.""",0,NA
"Perfect! You've used conditionals correctly in your sentences. 

Now, let's practice 'asking questions'. In English, we typically use 'wh' words like what, where, who, when and why to ask questions.

Could you please ask me five questions using these 'wh' words? For example, ""What's your favorite book?"" or ""Where do you live?""","1. What is your name?
2. Where are you from?
3. Who is your best friend?

5. Why do you like learning English?",0,NA
